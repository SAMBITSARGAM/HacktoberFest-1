#Data_Visualization_HacktoberFest2020


I am using data visualization for understanding about data in much more efficient and perfect manner. In this Problem i am using Python Inbuilt Modules and Packages
to form garphs.Data visualization is  important Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner â€“ and you can experiment with different scenarios by making slight adjustments.

->Data visualization can also:

>> Identify areas that need attention or improvement.
>> Clarify which factors influence customer behavior.
>> Help you understand which products to place where.
>> Predict sales volumes.

graphs and charts i am forming here such as:
>> Histogram,
>> Bar-Chart,
>> Pie-Chart,
>> Area-Plot
